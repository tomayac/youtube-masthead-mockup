## Dependencies

Element dependencies are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can
install that via:

```bash
    npm install -g bower
```

Then, go ahead and download the element's dependencies:

```bash
    bower install
```


## Playing With the Element

If you wish to work on your element in isolation, we recommend that you use
[Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve) to keep your element's
bower dependencies in line. You can install it via:

    npm install -g polyserve

And you can run it via:

    polyserve

Once running, you can preview your element at
`http://localhost:8080/components/youtube-masthead-mockup/`, where `youtube-masthead-mockup` is the name of the directory containing it.
